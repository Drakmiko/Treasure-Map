This project represents is one of my first project to get familiar with strings 
and the random module in Python

A treasure map string represents a rectangular grid comprised of rows and columns.
There are two-dimensional maps and three dimensional maps.
A treasure map can be of any rectangular size (not necessarily 3x3 nor square), and can contain different
symbols. There are movement symbols, an empty symbol, a treasure symbol and a breadcrumb symbol.
Our goal when given a treasure map is to follow the trail in it, character by character, and the symbols
will tell us how to follow the trail.
The empty symbol means to continue going in the same direction that
we were going in when we got to this character.
The treasure symbol operates the same as the empty symbol, except
that we also add one to our count of the treasure we have found while 
following the trail.
Finally, the breadcrumb symbol is a character that we will put in the
map: as we follow the trail, we will replace movement symbols by this 
symbol after we visit them, to indicate that we have been there.
